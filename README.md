This is a simple p5.js implementation of one dimensional cellular automata inspired by [Wolfram MathWorld](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/ElementaryCellularAutomaton.html).

You can pretty easily select any of the possible 2‚Å∏=256 rules mentioned on their website. Just change the lookup-table in Cell.js like documented.

This project is also hosted on the p5.js Web Editor: https://editor.p5js.org/vertiKarl/sketches/WPBfZ4ZML
